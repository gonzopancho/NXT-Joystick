NXT-Joystick
============

Drive a NXT bot with iPhone. Since Bluetooth connections cannot be made directly to the NXT brick from iPhone, a 'Server' component is required (included). iPhone 4 is also required to run the client program, as the gyroscope is used to track the device attitude.

Usage
-----

1. Run the 'Server' program on your Mac and connect to a NXT brick with its left and right motors connected to ports B and C, respectively
2. Run the iPhone client and select your Mac in the device browser
3. Once a connection is established, the iPhone client will start sending device attitude data to your Mac
